# TFOD-Object-detection-Mask-no-Mask

This is project to identify whether person wearing Mask and No Mask created with around 200 images manually labelled and train to get best output.

I am using faster RCNN inception V2 to train this model with 200000 steps.

I manage to achieve 99% accuracy.

If you have camera in your system it will be able to detect many person with Mask and no Mask
